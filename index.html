      <h1>What is recycle?</h1>
      <p>
        Recycling is the process of <mark>converting waste materials into new products</mark> to prevent them from ending up in landfills or the environment. It involves collecting, sorting, cleaning, and processing recyclable materials such as paper, plastic, glass, and metal so that they can be turned into new items. Recycling helps to conserve natural resources, reduce pollution, and save energy.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1>Why recycle?</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Recycling is important because it helps to:</b>
        <ol>Conserve natural resources by reducing the need to extract and process new raw materials from the earth.</ol>
        <ol>Reduce landfill waste, which reduces the amount of waste that ends up in the environment and decreases greenhouse gas emissions.</ol>
        <ol>Save energy by using less energy to recycle materials than to manufacture new products from raw materials.</ol>
        <ol>Decrease pollution by reducing the amount of waste that is burned or buried in landfills, which can release harmful toxins into the environment.</ol>
        <ol>Promote sustainability by reducing our impact on the environment and preserving natural resources for future generations.</ol>
    </p>

    <h1>what is e-waste and how to recycle it</h1>
    <p>
        <b>E-waste, or electronic waste, refers to discarded electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, televisions, and other electronic equipment. E-waste contains hazardous materials that can harm the environment if not disposed of properly. </b>
        <hr>
        To recycle e-waste, you can follow these steps:
        <ol>Find a certified e-waste recycling facility: Look for a recycling center or service provider that is certified by regulatory authorities to handle and dispose of e-waste safely.</ol>
        <ol>Remove personal data: Before recycling any electronic device, make sure to remove all personal data and information from the device to protect your privacy</ol>
        <ol>Drop off or arrange for pickup: You can either drop off your e-waste at a recycling facility or arrange for pickup services, which may be provided by the recycling center or a waste disposal service.</ol>
        <ol>Ensure proper handling: When recycling e-waste, it's important to ensure that it is handled and disposed of properly to prevent harm to the environment and human health. The recycling facility should have the necessary equipment and processes to safely dismantle and recycle electronic devices while minimizing the release of hazardous materials.</ol>
        By recycling e-waste, we can reduce the amount of electronic waste that ends up in landfills and prevent the release of harmful toxins into the environment.
